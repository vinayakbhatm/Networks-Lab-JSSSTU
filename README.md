# Networks-Lab-JSSSTU

## **JAVA**
1. Write a program to sort frames using appropriate sorting techniques.
2. Write a program for error detecting code using CRC-CCITT (16- bits).
3. Write a program to find the shortest path between vertices using bellman-ford algorithm.
4. Using TCP/IP sockets, write a client – server program to make the client send the file name and to make the server send back the contents of the requested file if present
5. Write a program on datagram socket for client/server to display the messages on client side, typed at the server side
6. Write a program for simple RSA algorithm to encrypt and decrypt the data
7. Write a program for congestion control using leaky bucket algorithm and token bucket algorithm
8. Write a program to implement random early detection (RED) congestion control algorithm.

## **Simulation**

9. Implement three nodes point – to – point network with duplex links between them. Set the queue size, vary the bandwidth and find the number of packets dropped
10. Implement transmission of ping messages/trace route over a network topology consisting of 6 nodes and find the number of packets dropped due to congestion
11. Implement an Ethernet LAN using n nodes and set multiple traffic nodes and plot congestion window for different source / destination.
12. Implement simple ESS and with transmitting nodes in wire-less LAN by simulation and determine the performance with respect to transmission of packets
